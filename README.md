# Csharp Spellbook
A collection(spellbook) with various libraries, tools, design patterns, prototypes, architectures, around C# language and Dotnet.

## About this spellbook
The spellbook, as I say it, is actually a collection with pieces of code for CSharp and Dotnet, around various themes of programming like pattern designs, technologies and frameworks from the programming language, some architecture designs which can lead to cleaner and more robust code, and other topics.

My goal here is to have a place for me and anyone else, where someone can find a useful piece of code when they need it, and understand easily how it can be implemented, what it does, how it can be changed and what it has to offer to you.
